= Yaml2Csv

Transform YAML file into CSV and backwards. CSV files contain
triplets [path, key, value]. For example:

    path1:
      path11:
        key11a: value11a
        key11b: value11b
      path12:
        path121:
          key121a: value121a
    path2:
      key2a: value2a
  
Will be converted into:

    path1/path11,key11a,value11a
    path1/path11,key11b,value11b
    path1/path12/path121,key121a,value121a
    path2,key2a,value2a

Source YAML files should contain only hash and string values. While non-string 
values (i.e. arrays, booleans) are allowed, they will be treated as strings 
thus their format will be lost.
